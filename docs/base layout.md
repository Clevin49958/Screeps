# Basic layout of the room

## Main branch

* One long branch leading from the controller to the furthest of the resource.
* The branch will be mostly diagonal to layout as many extensions along side as possible
* Side branches leading to 
    - Other sources
    - Minerals
    - Mid of each exits? definetely if room is useful // TODO

## Pile of structure near the controller

1. The closest is planed for storage (a container in early game)
     - there is a spot for upgrader
2. A plot for Base Manager, which is a small creep, with body == [CARRY] (maybe also a move)
    The manager will be surrounded by
    - A link to receive energy from sources
    - The Storage
    - A spawn
    - A power spawn
    - useually 2 tile of roads (enter and exit, at top and right e.g.)
    - A tower
    - An extension / a second tower?
